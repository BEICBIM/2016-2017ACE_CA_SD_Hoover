Mechanical Systems notes from [Juanita Warner's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanita-warner-40b56015) presentation included information on the different types of HVAC systems and considerations for choosing a system. Some of the primary considerations included:

* Zoning – how we are going to control comfort of spaces.
* Building exposure – orientation to the sun – windows and doors
* Space use – occupancy and use (computers etc.)  dictate the spaces conditioning needs.
* Use of natural ventilation – sometime not enough to offset the space needs.
* Exposed or concealed duct work - The group chose to have the east half open ceilings with exposed ducts and the west half with above ceiling duct system.
* Gas or electric – need to determine our point of services for the building.
* Location of units – exterior (roof or at grade) and interior - (mechanical room or ceiling/attic space)

While working on the mechanical design, the group work focused on specific use of the spaces; progress was made but needs to be finalized.  The [architecture notes summary](https://github.com/BEICBIM/2016-2017ACE_CA_SD_Hoover/blob/master/Docs/TeamWorkingDocs/ArchitectureTeam/20170124Notes.md) for the previous meeting is helpful to review and stimulate thought for defining the end user needs of our design.
