Mechanical Systems notes from Juanita's presentation included information on the different types of HVAC systems and considerations for choosing a system. Some of the primary considerations included:

* Zoning – how we are going to control comfort of spaces.
* Building exposure – orientation to the sun – windows and doors
* Space use – occupancy and use (computers etc.)  dictate the spaces conditioning needs.
* Use of natural ventilation – sometime not enough to offset the space needs.
* Exposed or concealed duct work - The group chose to have the east half open ceilings with exposed ducts and the west half with above ceiling duct system.
* Gas or electric – need to determine our point of services for the building.
* Location of units – exterior (roof or at grade) and interior - (mechanical room or ceiling/attic space)

While working on the mechanical design, the group work focused on specific use of the spaces; progress was made but needs to be finalized.  The architecture notes summary for the previous meeting is helpful to review and stimulate thought for defining the end user needs of our design.
